# ddev-fzf <!-- omit in toc -->

For now, I won't be providing releases, please install with 

```
ddev get https://github.com/hanoii/ddev-fzf/tarball/main
```

This adds [fzf]https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to the container. 

It's a nice addition to bash for those who ssh a lot, it's also optionally used 
by [zoxide](https://github.com/hanoii/ddev-zoxide).
